      This is a paragraph that contain words, lots of words. Endeless words down in this
      site, meaningless cacophony of useless words. But, in the deep of this useless text,
      maybe just maybe there's hope for something good to come. I like to play hearthstone.

    <h3>A little bit about crazy ideas</h3>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Something really good to remember is to never forgot the oven on, or else there's
                chance for something
                <strong><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1opgCstxyw">unfortunate</a></strong> to occur.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another really good tip is to always respect
                everyone. You never know, the person that you are greeting today can be the one to
                save your life tomorrow. <em><a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Or to end it</a>.</em>
            </li> 
            <li>
                Finally, my last crazy ideia is to always carry about your mental health. It's not good
                tu push yourself a lot more than you can handle, you know? What does it even matter if you
                win a lot of money doing that to in the end spend the rest of your life in an asylum without
                conditions to use it?
            </li>
        </ul>
